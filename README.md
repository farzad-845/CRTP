## Producer-Consumer Dynamic Rate Adjustment System
### University of Padova - A.A. 2023-24

---

## Objective

- To develop a system that allows dynamic adjustment of message production rate based on the consumer's processing capability.
- To implement a monitoring actor that controls the message flow to prevent overproduction or underproduction.
- To ensure the system maintains a balanced load, optimizing resource utilization and maintaining system stability.

---

## Project Description
This project implements a producer-consumer model where the producer generates messages at a variable rate, and the consumer processes these messages at a consistent rate. A separate monitoring component oversees the queue length to adjust the production rate dynamically based on a defined threshold. This mechanism aims to maintain efficient message processing without overloading the consumer or idling the producer.

---

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- **Functional Requirements:**
    - The system should be able to produce and consume messages.
    - A separate monitoring actor must adjust the message production rate.
    - The consumer should process messages with a given delay to simulate real-world usage.

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Performance:** The system must perform efficiently under varying load conditions.
    - **Scalability:** It should accommodate changes in production and consumption rates without significant modifications.
    - **Reliability:** The system should handle errors gracefully without crashing.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware Requirements:**
    - A computing environment capable of running concurrent processes or threads.

- **Software Requirements:**
    - An operating system that supports multitasking (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS).
    - A programming environment that supports concurrency (e.g., Python with asyncio, Java with ExecutorService).
    - Necessary libraries for queue management and threading/multiprocessing.

## Output of the Project

The output of the project will be a functional producer-consumer system where:
- The producer's rate of message generation is adjusted dynamically by the monitor actor based on the queueâ€™s length.
- The consumer consistently processes messages at a pre-set delay.
- The system maintains an optimal queue length, ensuring that the consumer operates efficiently without being overburdened, and the producer does not remain idle for too long or overwhelm the syst

Producer-(single) consumer program with dynamic message rate adjustment. The consumer shall consume messages at a given rate, that is, with a given delay simulating the consumed message usage. An actor (task or process) separate from producer and consumer shall periodically check the message queue length and if the length is below a given threshold, it will increase the production rate. Otherwise (i.e. the message length is above the given threshold), it will decrease the production rate.
